# Getting started

To get started you will need a create a new firebase project, which must be a webapp and use the Cloud Fire Store.
Once a database has been provisioned, add two collections to it. the fist being "messages" and the other being "usernames"

Next you will need to fill in your .env file with your firebase credentials. Use the ".env.example" as a starting point.

If you haven't done so already, run "yarn" in the root of the project to install all the required dependencies.

Finally, once all the above steps have been followed the project can be started by running "yarn start". A new browser window should open and the app should be waiting for you.
